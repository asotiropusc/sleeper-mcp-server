# Sleeper üèà Model Context Protocol Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides users with access to their historic performance across their Sleeper leagues. This server also provides access to current season details.

## Key Files

### `index.ts`

- Defines the 15 listed MCP tools below:
  - `get-current-nfl-week` - Current NFL week information
  - `get-trending-players` - Most added/dropped players league-wide
  - `get-user-roster-trending-players` - Trending players on user's roster
  - `get-league-names-for-user` - All leagues for a username
  - `get-league-settings` - General league configuration
  - `get-league-playoff-schedule` - Playoff structure and timing
  - `get-league-scoring-settings` - Detailed scoring rules
  - `get-league-roster-settings` - Starting lineup requirements
  - `get-matchup-details` - Head-to-head matchup summaries for a given week
  - `get-matchup-starters` - Retrieves the starters on both teams for a given matchup
  - `get-league-playoff-history` - Historical playoff results
  - `get-matchup-bench` - Retrieves the benched players on both teams for a given matchup
  - `get-bench-starter-analysis` - Lineup optimization analysis for a given matchup
  - `get-season-head-to-head` - Complete rivalry records across seasons
  - `get-league-playoff-bracket` - Retrieves the playoff bracket for a league

### `utils/processors.ts`

- This file is responsible for implementation details for tools that require historical data lookup.
- We define a function called `processLeagueDataByYear` which facilitates access to historical league information.
  - This is essential because the Sleeper API does not provide direct access to historical league data and so a league chain must be constructed manually by following `previous_league_id` references.
  - This function allows the client to provide year ranges such as `"2022"`, `"2022-2024"`, `"2020, 2022, 2024"`.
  - Each tool that utilizes this function needs to provide a processor function, which formats the outputs for the specific year based on the type of endpoints being accessed.

### `utils/api.ts`

- Houses the api calls for communication with the Sleeper API.
